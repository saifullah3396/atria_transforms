# Python Docstring Guidelines for Consistent Documentation

## General Guidelines:
1. **Format**:
   - Use triple double quotes (`"""`).
   - Each docstring should start with a one-line summary of what the function/class/method does.
   - If the function is short and self-explanatory, a one-liner is sufficient.
   - If the function is complex, include a more detailed explanation after the summary.
   - Include a section for parameters (`Args:`), return values (`Returns:`), and exceptions (`Raises:`) where applicable.
   - Provide type hints in the parameter and return sections (e.g., `param1 (str)`).
   - Separate sections by a blank line for readability.
   - If the method has any side effects (e.g., modifies global state), note them.
   - For functions or methods, ensure you describe the return value and the types clearly.
   
2. **Docstring Structure**:
   - For **functions**:
     ```python
     def function_name(param1: type, param2: type) -> return_type:
         """
         Short description of what the function does.

         Detailed explanation if necessary.

         Args:
             param1 (type): Description of param1.
             param2 (type): Description of param2.

         Returns:
             return_type: Description of what the function returns.

         Raises:
             ExceptionType: Condition under which the exception is raised.
         """
     ```

   - For **methods** (same as functions, but within the context of a class):
     ```python
     class ClassName:
         def method_name(self, param1: type) -> return_type:
             """
             Short description of what the method does.

             Detailed explanation if necessary.

             Args:
                 param1 (type): Description of param1.

             Returns:
                 return_type: Description of what the method returns.

             Raises:
                 ExceptionType: Condition under which the exception is raised.
             """
     ```

   - For **classes**:
     ```python
     class ClassName:
         """
         Short description of what the class represents.

         Detailed explanation of the class's purpose and usage.

         Attributes:
             attr1 (type): Description of attr1.
             attr2 (type): Description of attr2.
         """
     ```

3. **Be Consistent**: Always maintain consistent terminology and style across the codebase. For instance:
   - Use "Args" for parameters and "Returns" for return types.
   - Always mention the data types for parameters and return values.
   - When mentioning exceptions in the "Raises" section, use the full exception class name (e.g., `ValueError`, not just `error`).

4. **Parameter and Return Documentation**:
   - **Parameters**: Include the parameter name, type, and a brief description.
   - **Return**: Include the return type and a description of what is returned.
   - **Raises**: Document any exceptions that might be raised, the conditions under which they are raised, and the type of the exception.

5. **Additional Sections**:
   - If there are any **side effects** (e.g., modifying global variables, I/O operations), document them under a "Side Effects" section.
   - If the function or method is part of a **larger algorithm**, briefly explain its role in the algorithm.
   - If the method is overriding another method, document that it is overriding the base class method.

## Example Docstring for a Function:

```python
def calculate_total_price(items: List[float], tax_rate: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the total price including tax.

    This function computes the total cost of the items in the list, applies the provided
    tax rate, and returns the final total price.

    Args:
        items (List[float]): A list of item prices.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate to apply to the total price.

    Returns:
        float: The total price after tax is applied.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `items` is empty or `tax_rate` is negative.
    """
```

## Example Docstring for a Class:
```python
class ShoppingCart:
"""
Represents a shopping cart for an e-commerce system.

The ShoppingCart class is responsible for managing items in the cart,
calculating the total price, and applying discounts or tax rates.

Attributes:
    items (List[Item]): A list of items in the shopping cart.
    discount (float): A discount to apply to the total price.

## Example Docstring for a File:
"""
Module for Data Processing, Model Training, and Evaluation

This module provides utilities for handling datasets, preprocessing, 
and training machine learning models. It includes functions for loading 
and batching datasets, managing data pipelines, training models, and 
evaluating model performance. This module is intended for use in scalable 
machine learning workflows, supporting tasks such as model training, 
validation, and logging.

Key Components:
    - `load_data()`: Loads and preprocesses datasets for model training.
    - `train_model()`: Defines and executes model training on the provided dataset.
    - `evaluate_model()`: Evaluates model performance on a validation or test set.
    - `DataPipeline`: Manages dataset loading, preprocessing, and batching during training.
    - `ModelTrainer`: Handles training, validation, and logging of model performance.

Usage Example:
    ```python
    # Initialize the data pipeline
    data_pipeline = DataPipeline(dataset_path="/path/to/data")

    # Load and preprocess data
    train_data, val_data = data_pipeline.load_data()

    # Train the model
    model_trainer = ModelTrainer(model=model, data_pipeline=data_pipeline)
    model_trainer.train()

    # Evaluate the model
    model_trainer.evaluate()
    ```

Dependencies:
    - `torch`: Required for model training and tensor manipulation.
    - `torchvision`: For image preprocessing utilities.
    - `pandas`: For dataset handling and data manipulation.
